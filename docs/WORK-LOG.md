## 2026-10-11 — The WaveCenter space gets its own development loop (#2)

WaveCenter now has the same spec → build → review process StarCaster runs,
pointed at its own ClickUp list, **Loop Queue** in the WaveCenter space. This
repo gained the three loop skills, a small command-line door into ClickUp
(`npm run clickup`), an operator guide, the click-by-click status setup for the
new list, a CI check, and a guard that refuses edits on `main`. Keys live in a
new `wavecenter` Doppler project from day one; the ClickUp token is borrowed
from StarCaster's by reference rather than copied.
